"Many people would like to know beforehand approximately how long it takes to "
"compile and install each package. Because Linux From Scratch can be built on "
"many different systems, it is impossible to provide accurate time "
"estimates. The biggest package (Glibc) will take approximately 20 minutes on "
"the fastest systems, but could take up to three days on slower systems! "
"Instead of providing actual times, the Standard Build Unit (SBU) measure "
"will be used instead."

"The SBU measure works as follows. The first package to be compiled from this "
"book is binutils in <xref linkend=\"chapter-cross-tools\"/>. The time it "
"takes to compile this package is what will be referred to as the Standard "
"Build Unit or SBU. All other compile times will be expressed relative to "
"this time."

"For example, consider a package whose compilation time is 4.5 SBUs. This "
"means that if a system took 10 minutes to compile and install the first pass "
"of binutils, it will take <emphasis>approximately</emphasis> 45 minutes to "
"build this example package.  Fortunately, most build times are shorter than "
"the one for binutils."

"In general, SBUs are not entirely accurate because they depend on many "
"factors, including the host system's version of GCC.  They are provided here "
"to give an estimate of how long it might take to install a package, but the "
"numbers can vary by as much as dozens of minutes in some cases."

"For many modern systems with multiple processors (or cores) the compilation "
"time for a package can be reduced by performing a \"parallel make\" by "

"<command>make</command> program how many processors are available.  For "

"When multiple processors are used in this way, the SBU units in the book "
"will vary even more than they normally would.  In some cases, the make step "
"will simply fail.  Analyzing the output of the build process will also be "
"more difficult because the lines of different processes will be "
"interleaved.  If you run into a problem with a build step, revert back to a "
"single processor build to properly analyze the error messages."
