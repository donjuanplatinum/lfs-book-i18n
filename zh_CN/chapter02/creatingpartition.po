"Like most other operating systems, LFS is usually installed on a dedicated "
"partition. The recommended approach to building an LFS system is to use an "
"available empty partition or, if you have enough unpartitioned space, to "
"create one."

"A minimal system requires a partition of around 10 gigabytes (GB).  This is "
"enough to store all the source tarballs and compile the packages.  However, "
"if the LFS system is intended to be the primary Linux system, additional "
"software will probably be installed which will require additional space. A "
"30 GB partition is a reasonable size to provide for growth.  The LFS system "
"itself will not take up this much room.  A large portion of this requirement "
"is to provide sufficient free temporary storage as well as for adding "
"additional capabilities after LFS is complete. Additionally, compiling "
"packages can require a lot of disk space which will be reclaimed after the "
"package is installed."

"Because there is not always enough Random Access Memory (RAM) available for "
"compilation processes, it is a good idea to use a small disk partition as "
"<systemitem class=\"filesystem\">swap</systemitem> space. This is used by "
"the kernel to store seldom-used data and leave more memory available for "
"active processes. The <systemitem class=\"filesystem\">swap</systemitem> "
"partition for an LFS system can be the same as the one used by the host "
"system, in which case it is not necessary to create another one."

"Requests for advice on system partitioning are often posted on the LFS "
"mailing lists. This is a highly subjective topic.  The default for most "
"distributions is to use the entire drive with the exception of one small "
"swap partition.  This is not optimal for LFS for several reasons.  It "
"reduces flexibility, makes sharing of data across multiple distributions or "
"LFS builds more difficult, makes backups more time consuming, and can waste "
"disk space through inefficient allocation of file system structures."

"Swapping is never good. For mechanical hard drives you can generally tell if "
"a system is swapping by just listening to disk activity and observing how "
"the system reacts to commands.  For an SSD drive you will not be able to "
"hear swapping but you can tell how much swap space is being used by the "
"<command>top</command> or <command>free</command> programs.  Use of an SSD "
"drive for a swap partition should be avoided if possible.  The first "
"reaction to swapping should be to check for an unreasonable command such as "
"trying to edit a five gigabyte file. If swapping becomes a normal "
"occurrence, the best solution is to purchase more RAM for your system."
