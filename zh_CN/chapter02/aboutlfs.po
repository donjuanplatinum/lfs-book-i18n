"Throughout this book, the environment variable <envar>LFS</envar> will be "
"used several times. You should ensure that this variable is always defined "
"throughout the LFS build process. It should be set to the name of the "
"directory where you will be building your LFS system - we will use <filename "
"class=\"directory\">/mnt/lfs</filename> as an example, but the directory "
"choice is up to you. If you are building LFS on a separate partition, this "
"directory will be the mount point for the partition.  Choose a directory "
"location and set the variable with the following command:"

"One way to ensure that the <envar>LFS</envar> variable is always set is to "
"edit the <filename>.bash_profile</filename> file in both your personal home "
"directory and in <filename>/root/.bash_profile</filename> and enter the "
"export command above.  In addition, the shell specified in the "
"<filename>/etc/passwd</filename> file for all users that need the "
"<envar>LFS</envar> variable needs to be bash to ensure that the "
"<filename>/root/.bash_profile</filename> file is incorporated as a part of "

"Another consideration is the method that is used to log into the host "
"system.  If logging in through a graphical display manager, the user's "
"<filename>.bash_profile</filename> is not normally used when a virtual "
"terminal is started.  In this case, add the export command to the "
"<filename>.bashrc</filename> file for the user and root.  In addition, some "
"distributions have instructions to not run the <filename>.bashrc</filename> "
"instructions in a non-interactive bash invocation.  Be sure to add the "
"export command before the test for non-interactive use."
