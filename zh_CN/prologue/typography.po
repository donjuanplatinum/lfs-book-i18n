"This format is used to refer to a specific manual (man) page. The number "
"inside parentheses indicates a specific section inside the manuals. For "
"example, <command>passwd</command> has two man pages. Per LFS installation "
"instructions, those two man pages will be located at "
"<filename>/usr/share/man/man1/passwd.1</filename> and "
"<filename>/usr/share/man/man5/passwd.5</filename>. When the book uses "
"<filename>passwd(5)</filename> it is specifically referring to "
"<filename>/usr/share/man/man5/passwd.5</filename>.  <command>man "
"passwd</command> will print the first man page it finds that matches "
"<quote>passwd</quote>, which will be "
"<filename>/usr/share/man/man1/passwd.1</filename>. For this example, you "
"will need to run <command>man 5 passwd</command> in order to read the page "
"being specified. Note that most man pages do not have duplicate page names "
"in different sections. Therefore, <command>man <replaceable>&lt;program "
"name&gt;</replaceable></command> is generally sufficient."
