"My journey to learn and better understand Linux began back in 1998. I had "
"just installed my first Linux distribution and had quickly become intrigued "
"with the whole concept and philosophy behind Linux."

"There are always many ways to accomplish a single task. The same can be said "
"about Linux distributions. A great many have existed over the years.  Some "
"still exist, some have morphed into something else, yet others have been "
"relegated to our memories.  They all do things differently to suit the needs "
"of their target audience.  Because so many different ways to accomplish the "
"same end goal exist, I began to realize I no longer had to be limited by any "
"one implementation. Prior to discovering Linux, we simply put up with issues "
"in other Operating Systems as you had no choice. It was what it was, whether "
"you liked it or not. With Linux, the concept of choice began to emerge.  If "
"you didn't like something, you were free, even encouraged, to change it."

"I tried a number of distributions and could not decide on any one. They were "
"great systems in their own right. It wasn't a matter of right and wrong "
"anymore. It had become a matter of personal taste. With all that choice "
"available, it became apparent that there would not be a single system that "
"would be perfect for me. So I set out to create my own Linux system that "
"would fully conform to my personal preferences."

"To truly make it my own system, I resolved to compile everything from source "
"code instead of using pre-compiled binary packages. This "
"<quote>perfect</quote> Linux system would have the strengths of various "
"systems without their perceived weaknesses. At first, the idea was rather "
"daunting. I remained committed to the idea that such a system could be "
"built."

"After sorting through issues such as circular dependencies and compile-time "
"errors, I finally built a custom-built Linux system. It was fully "
"operational and perfectly usable like any of the other Linux systems out "
"there at the time. But it was my own creation. It was very satisfying to "
"have put together such a system myself. The only thing better would have "
"been to create each piece of software myself. This was the next best thing."

"As I shared my goals and experiences with other members of the Linux "
"community, it became apparent that there was a sustained interest in these "
"ideas. It quickly became plain that such custom-built Linux systems serve "
"not only to meet user specific requirements, but also serve as an ideal "
"learning opportunity for programmers and system administrators to enhance "
"their (existing) Linux skills. Out of this broadened interest, the "
"<emphasis>Linux From Scratch Project</emphasis> was born."

"This Linux From Scratch book is the central core around that project. It "
