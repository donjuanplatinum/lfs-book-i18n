"existing knowledge of Unix system administration in order to resolve "
"problems and correctly execute the commands listed. In particular, as an "
"absolute minimum, you should already have the ability to use the command "
"line (shell) to copy or move files and directories, list directory and file "
"contents, and change the current directory. It is also expected that you "
