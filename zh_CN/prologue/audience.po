"One important reason for this project's existence is to help you learn how a "
"Linux system works from the inside out. Building an LFS system helps "
"demonstrate what makes Linux tick, and how things work together and depend "
"on each other. One of the best things this learning experience can provide "
"is the ability to customize a Linux system to suit your own unique needs."
msgstr ""
"LFS 项目存在的一项重要原因是，它能够帮助您学习 Linux 系统的内部是如何运作的。"
"构建 LFS 系统的过程将展示 Linux 系统的工作原理，以及其各组成部分的协作和依赖"
"关系。最棒的是，有了这些经验，您将能够定制 Linux 系统，使其满足您独一无二的需"
"求。"

"Another key benefit of LFS is that it gives you control of the system "
"without relying on someone else's Linux implementation. With LFS, you are in "
"the driver's seat. <emphasis>You</emphasis> dictate every aspect of your "
"system."

"LFS 的另一个关键优势是，它允许您掌控您的系统，而不用依赖于其他人的 Linux 实"
"现。在使用 LFS 时，您就像坐在驾驶座上一样，<emphasis>亲自</emphasis>掌控系统"

"LFS allows you to create very compact Linux systems. With other "
"distributions you are often forced to install a great many programs you "
"neither use nor understand. These programs waste resources. You may argue "
"that with today's hard drives and CPUs, wasted resources are no longer a "
"consideration. Sometimes, however, you are still constrained by the system's "
"size, if nothing else. Think about bootable CDs, USB sticks, and embedded "
"systems. Those are areas where LFS can be beneficial."
msgstr ""
"LFS 允许您创建非常紧凑的 Linux 系统。在安装其他发行版时，您往往不得不安装一大"
"堆永远不会用到或者意义不明的程序。它们会浪费系统资源。您可能以为，有了现代的"
"大容量硬盘和高速 CPU，就不需要考虑资源浪费的问题。然而，在一些情况下，即使不"
"考虑其他问题，仅仅存储空间的约束就十分紧张。典型的代表有可引导 CD，USB 启动"
"盘，以及嵌入式系统。在这些领域中，LFS 是十分有用的。"

"Another advantage of a custom built Linux system is security. By compiling "
"the entire system from source code, you are empowered to audit everything "
"and apply all the security patches you want. You don't have to wait for "
"somebody else to compile binary packages that fix a security hole.  Unless "
"you examine the patch and implement it yourself, you have no guarantee that "
"the new binary package was built correctly and adequately fixes the problem."

"自行定制的 Linux 系统在安全方面也具有优势。在从源码编译整个系统的过程中，您有"
"机会审核所有的代码，并安装您需要的安全补丁。您不需要像往常那样等待其他人编译"
"一个修复了安全漏洞的二进制包。另外，除非您亲自检查并应用了补丁，您无法保证新"
"的二进制包在编译过程中没有出问题，并且正确修补了安全漏洞。"

"There are too many good reasons to build your own LFS system to list them "
