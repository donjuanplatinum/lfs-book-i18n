"The primary target architectures of LFS are the AMD/Intel x86 (32-bit)  and "
"x86_64 (64-bit) CPUs.  On the other hand, the instructions in this book are "
"also known to work, with some modifications, with the Power PC and ARM "
"CPUs. To build a system that utilizes one of these CPUs, the main "
"prerequisite, in addition to those on the next page, is an existing Linux "
"system such as an earlier LFS installation, Ubuntu, Red Hat/Fedora, SuSE, or "
"other distribution that targets the architecture that you have. Also note "
"that a 32-bit distribution can be installed and used as a host system on a "
"64-bit AMD/Intel computer."

"For building LFS, the gain of building on a 64-bit system compared to a "
"32-bit system is minimal.  For example, in a test build of LFS-9.1 on a Core "
"i7-4790 CPU based system, using 4 cores, the following statistics were "
"measured:"

"As you can see, on the same hardware, the 64-bit build is only 3% faster and "
"is 22% larger than the 32-bit build. If you plan to use LFS as a LAMP "
"server, or a firewall, a 32-bit CPU may be largely sufficient. On the other "
"hand, several packages in BLFS now need more than 4GB of RAM to be built "
"and/or to run, so that if you plan to use LFS as a desktop, the LFS authors "
"recommend building on a 64-bit system."

"The default 64-bit build that results from LFS is considered a "
"<quote>pure</quote> 64-bit system. That is, it supports 64-bit executables "
"only. Building a <quote>multi-lib</quote> system requires compiling many "
"applications twice, once for a 32-bit system and once for a 64-bit system.  "
"This is not directly supported in LFS because it would interfere with the "
"educational objective of providing the instructions needed for a "
"straightforward base Linux system. Some LFS/BLFS editors maintain a fork of "
"LFS for multilib, which is accessible at <ulink "
"url=\"http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/~thomas/multilib/index.html\"/>. But "
"it is an advanced topic."
