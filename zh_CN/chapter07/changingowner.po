"Currently, the whole directory hierarchy in <filename "
"class=\"directory\">$LFS</filename> is owned by the user <systemitem "
"class=\"username\">lfs</systemitem>, a user that exists only on the host "
"system. If the directories under <filename "
"class=\"directory\">$LFS</filename> are kept as they are, the files are "
"owned by a user ID without a corresponding account. This is dangerous "
"because a user account created later could get this same user ID and would "
"own all the files under <filename class=\"directory\">$LFS</filename>, thus "
"exposing these files to possible malicious manipulation."
