"This chapter shows how to build the last missing bits of the temporary "
"system: first, the tools needed by the build machinery of various packages, "
"then three packages needed to run tests.  Now that all circular dependencies "
"have been resolved, we can use a <quote>chroot</quote> environment, "
"completely isolated the host operating system used for the build, except for "
"the running kernel."

"For proper operation of the isolated environment, some communication with "
"the running kernel must be established. This is done through the so-called "
"<emphasis>Virtual Kernel File Systems</emphasis>, which must be mounted when "
"entering the chroot environment. You may want to check that they are mounted "
"by issuing <command>findmnt</command>."

"Until <xref linkend=\"ch-tools-chroot\"/>, the commands must be run as "
"<systemitem class=\"username\">root</systemitem>, with the "
"<envar>LFS</envar> variable set. After entering chroot, all commands are run "
"as root, fortunately without access to the OS of the computer you built LFS "
"on. Be careful anyway, as it is easy to destroy the whole LFS system with "
"badly formed commands."
