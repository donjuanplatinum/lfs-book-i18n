"This chapter includes a list of packages that need to be downloaded in order "
"to build a basic Linux system. The listed version numbers correspond to "
"versions of the software that are known to work, and this book is based on "
"their use. We highly recommend against using newer versions because the "
"build commands for one version may not work with a newer version. The newest "
"package versions may also have problems that require work-arounds. These "
"work-arounds will be developed and stabilized in the development version of "
"the book."
